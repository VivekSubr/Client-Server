A note on self signed certificates. 
------------------------------------------------
The ca cert generated by 'generate_tls_cert.sh' is self signed. Self signed certificates are created without reference to any
authority, and hence will have 'subject' and 'issuer' fields as same.

openssl x509 -in ca-crt -noout -issuer
issuer=C = US, ST = Denial, L = Springfield, O = Dis, CN = litest.com

openssl x509 -in ca-crt -noout -subject
subject=C = US, ST = Denial, L = Springfield, O = Dis, CN = litest.com

Hence it is own ca cert: openssl verify -CAfile ca-crt ca-crt
