Dynamic modules has two parts:

* First, there's the code that loads the shared object, defines an ABI and SDKs for creating it
https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/tree/main/source/extensions/dynamic_modules


* Second, there's a generic 'dynamic_module' http filter defined that must be inserted into envoy's config yaml to be used, like:
            http_filters:
                - name: dscp_filter
                  typed_config:
                    "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.http.dynamic_modules.v3.DynamicModuleFilter
                    dynamic_module_config: # this will try to load ${ENVOY_DYNAMIC_MODULES_SEARCH_PATH}/lib${name}.so
                      name: dscp_filter
                    filter_name: dscp_filter


This dynamic_module http filter is defined at source/common/extensions/filters/http/dynamic_modules, note that it derived from Http:StreamFilter.

A dynamic module is created and loaded by createFilterFactoryFromProtoTyped in factory.cc, which is turn invoked by call of base class,
source/extensions/filters/network/common/factory_base.h, by source/common/listener_manager/listener_manager_impl.cc         

The factory is used to create filter
